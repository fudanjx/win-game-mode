- **Gaming Profiles**: Includes specialized profiles for popular games:
  - CSGO: Maps mouse buttons to weapon quick-switch (2â†’1) with 1ms delay
  - Overwatch: Maps mouse buttons to left shift key
- **Special Gaming Mouse Support**: Enhanced support for gaming mice, including Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro
